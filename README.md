# PluginArchitecture
An example of a basic plugin architecture. This greeting application loads language plugins in different languages and displays the greeting respectively. 

As long as you drop the appropriate plugin dlls in the Plugin folder at the working directory, it should work just fine out-of-the-box.
The app dynamically loads plugings for different greeting languages and greets as per the user selected language.

This is a console app.
